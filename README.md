# Trends in Mental Health: Analyzing the Prevalence of Anxiety Disorders and Depression in the United States (1990-2017)
The repository contains a catalog of carefully selected subsets of data extracted from [Global Trends in Mental Health Disorder](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder) datasets. The initial dataset includes information from a worldwide perspective, detailing the prevalence of various mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, drug use disorders, alcohol use disorders, anxiety disorders, and depression. In addition, it contains a Python Jupyter Notebook that methodically documents the process of generating subsets and ensuring their reproducibility.

### Background Information
Mental health has increasingly become a focus of public health efforts in the United States, acknowledging its significant impact on overall well-being and productivity. In terms of prevalence, conditions such as anxiety disorders and depression are among the most common mental health challenges, impacting millions of Americans. The data from 1990 to 2017 indicates that the prevalence of these conditions has been increasing, suggesting a need for continued investment in mental health services, research into causative factors, and public health strategies aimed at prevention and early intervention.

### Data Visualization

Overall, the multi-line chart presentation allows for a comparison between the two mental health disorders, which indicates that while both have shown increases, the pattern for anxiety disorders contains more variability within the period, whereas depression shows a steadier increase. The sharp peak in anxiety disorders suggests a year or years of significant growth, which might need further research to understand the underlying factors contributing to this change.

- __Anxiety Disorders__: The graph for anxiety disorders shows a dramatic spike in prevalence from 1995 to 2010, which could suggest an external event, such as the inflation and financial crisis in the early 21st century, or a change in diagnostic practices that resulted in a surge in anxiety disorder diagnoses. After the spike, the prevalence quickly reverts to levels similar to those before the peak.
- __Depression__: The prevalence of depression has increased more steadily over the years, suggesting a gradual rise in the number of reported cases or diagnoses. This consistent climb might reflect several factors, including improved condition recognition, reduced stigma, popularization of mental health, and more accurate reporting. However, it could also indicate a genuine rise in the incidence of depression due to societal factors.
